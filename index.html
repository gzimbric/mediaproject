						<p>In the last century alone, Indonesia has lost <strong>15.79 million hectares</strong> of forest land
						<br />
						due to common needs like paper, furniture, and even homes. Forests are also typically cleared to make<br> more room for urbanization of large ciies in desperate need of expansion

										<h2>Trees aren't the only thing <strong>effected</strong> by deforestation. </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Deforestation effects many things other than just trees. One of the biggest effects of deforestation is driving and destroying habitats of many different species. Deforestation can also effect the temperature in forests as without trees animals and plants loose the essential shade they need. Another effect is global warming, as fewer forests means increased greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.  </p>
